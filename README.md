# Tiff

Tiff is a typeface diff tool that visually contrasts the differences between two
fonts. I had the idea of creating such a tool to help me compare two fonts while
learning about typography.

The app is currently running at [https://winniethemu.github.io/tiff](https://winniethemu.github.io/tiff)

### Fonts

At this point, [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts) serves as the only
source of external fonts for Tiff. However, I'm working on including more font
sources.

### Browser Support

Since the app uses some features only available in HTML5 and CSS3, use recent versions of
modern web browsers for maximum compatibility.

### Credits

Thanks to my friends Michael Choi and [Riobard Zhan](http://riobard.com/) for offering generous advice.

Thanks to [Mark Brown](https://twitter.com/markbrown4) for the original font aligning code.
